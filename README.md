In reality, users tend to reuse passwords or make trivial changes to their existing passwords to create new ones and use them across different sites for ease of memorization. So, creating secure passwords for every site has become a daunting task. To overcome this daunting and challenging task, PwdFly is available as a chrome extension, website, Android app to help users create secure passwords based on a Master Password and the site's URL as the key for that website. PwdFly generates site-specific secure passwords by taking the user's Master Password, the website's URL, email address of the user and the version for the password. The Master Password is the secret, the URL acts as the index, the email address concatenated with the URL acts as the salt, the version control is used to generate new passwords for a particular website without having the user to change the master password. PwdFly uses Scrypt as the one-way function which also serves as the key-stretching algorithm. The password generated by PwdFly ranges between 12 and 16 characters and it contains uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers and special characters and hence the generated site-specific passwords are compliant with every possible password policy.
